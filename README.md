This application is made for extracting several information from the CNRS HAL Database. At first, it was design to be really simple ... And we thought it is but not for our needs !

## Presentation :

## Achievement :

## Behind the scene :

This application is build using the famous framework Electron. Here is a small list of technologies we use :

* Electron
* AngularJS 1
* PouchDB
* Bulma
* ...

### Setup :

* Install : `npm install`
* Start application : `npm start`
* Package application : `npm start`

### Todo :

* Add test : Writing test for electron may be tricky sometimes... We didn't take the times to make it work
* Front framework : React or Angular2 will drastically improve performance on big request definition
* Extract each query fields : This will improve the performance when we have several complex output columns

As everyone know a desktop app has its own limitation ... For me (Patouche), this was also my first experience with Electron and I find it's a nice solution (but maybe not in our case).

So, a v2 is in progress and will arrived (one day) based on others technologies.
